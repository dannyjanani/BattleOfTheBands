# BattleOfTheBands
Graduate Real-Time Embedded System Project to create a band out of "air instruments".

## Project Guidelines

### Overview

* Team: 3 People (Band Members)
* A Four-Chord song was selected from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_containing_the_I–V–vi–IV_progression.
* Team perfoms selected song in front of class.
* All musical instruments were implemented using "Wearables" thus "Air Instruments".
* Audio output from each band members will be fed to a mixer using an RCA jack.
* Audio amp, speakers, mixer, and audio cables will be provided to the “band.”
* Any sensor may be used for chord implementation.
* Each band is encouraged to have a “performance” look.
* Air instruments should be invisible, made of air. 
The less the project LOOKS the
  better, but if you want to use minor props you can. Such as a stick for the guitar, or a drawing of a keyboard with keys on   the desk to know where keys are etc.
